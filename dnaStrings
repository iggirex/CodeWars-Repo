Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a chemical found in the nucleus of cells and carries the "instructions" for the development and functioning of living organisms.

If you want to know more http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA

In DNA strings, symbols "A" and "T" are complements of each other, as "C" and "G". You have function with one side of the DNA (string, except for Haskell); you need to get the other complementary side. DNA strand is never empty or there is no DNA at all (again, except for Haskell).

DNAStrand ("ATTGC") # return "TAACG"
DNAStrand ("GTAT") # return "CATA"



function DNAStrand(dna){
  //your code here
  var final = []
  var arr = dna.split("")
  for (var i = 0; i <arr.length; i++){
    if(arr[i] === "A"){
        final.push("T")
    } else if(arr[i] === "T"){
    	final.push("A")
    } else if(arr[i] === "C"){
    	final.push("G")
    } else if(arr[i] === "G"){
    	final.push("C")
    }
  }
  return final.join().replace(/,/g, "")
}
