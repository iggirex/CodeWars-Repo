Your task is to split the chocolate bar of given dimension n x m into small squares. Each square is of size 1x1 and unbreakable. Implement a function that will return minimum number of breaks needed.

For example if you are given a chocolate bar of size 2 x 1 you can split it to single squares in just one break, but for size 3 x 1 you must do two breaks.

If input data is invalid you should return 0 (as in no breaks are needed if we do not have any chocolate to split). Input will always be a non-negative integer.


var breakChocolate = function(n, m) {
if(!Number.isInteger(n) || !Number.isInteger(m) || !m || !n){
		return false
	}
	var small = 0
	var big = 0
	if (n>=m){
		big = n
		small = m
	} else{
		big = m
		small = n
	}
	let result = ((small -1)+((big-1)*small))
	console.log(big, small, result)
	return result
};
