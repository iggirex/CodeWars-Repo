Triangular numbers are so called because of the equilateral triangular shape that they occupy when laid out as dots. i.e.

1st (1)   2nd (3)    3rd (6)
*          **        ***
           *         **
                     *
You need to return the nth triangular number. You should return 0 for out of range values:

  triangular(0)==0,
  triangular(2)==3,
  triangular(3)==6,
  triangular(-10)==0


  // Return the nth triangular number
function triangular( n ) {
	if(n > 0){
	let counter = n
	let finCount = n
 	for ( var i = n ; i>0; i-- ) {
 		finCount += i -1
		  console.log(finCount, i)
		}
		return finCount
	} else {
		return 0
	}
}
