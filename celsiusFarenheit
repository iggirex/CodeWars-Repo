Your friend is traveling abroad to the United States so he wrote a program to convert fahrenheit to celsius. Unfortunately his code has some bugs.

Find the errors in the code to get the celsius converter working properly.


function convertToCelsius (temperature) {
  var celsius = (temperature - 32) * (5/9)
  return celsius
}

function weatherInfo (temp) {
  var c = convertToCelsius(temp)
  if (c < 0)
    return (c + " is freezing temperature")
  else
    return (c + " is above freezing temperature")
}
